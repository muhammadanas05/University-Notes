            <p style ="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;"> Beauty is the ascription of a property or characteristic to an animal,
                idea, object, person or place that provides a perceptual experience of 
                pleasure or satisfaction. Beauty is studied as part of aesthetics,
                culture, social psychology and sociology. An "ideal beauty" is an entity
                which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular
                culture, for perfection. Ugliness is the opposite of beauty. The experience of "beauty"
                often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature,
                which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being. Because this can be a
                subjective experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
                Often, given the observation that empirical observations of things that are considered beautiful
                often align among groups in consensus, beauty has been stated to have levels of objectivity and
                partial subjectivity which are not fully subjective in their aesthetic judgement.</p>
