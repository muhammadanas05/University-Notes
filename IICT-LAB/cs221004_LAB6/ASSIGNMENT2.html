    <p id="p1" style="background-color:white;">The 2022 FIFA World Cup is the 22nd FIFA World Cup,
            an international football tournament contested by the men's
            national teams of FIFA's member associations. It is taking
            place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022.
            It is the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world,
            and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament
            in South Korea and Japan. France are the defending champions,
            having defeated Croatia 4â€“2 in the 2018 final. At an estimated cost
            of over $220 billion, it is the most expensive World Cup ever held;
            this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organizing
             CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost is $8 billion,and
            other figures relate to overall infrastructure development since
            the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.This tournament
            is set to be the last with 32 participating teams, with the
            field to increase to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. To avoid
            the extremes of Qatar's hot climate, this World Cup is being
            held during November and December.It is being played in a
            reduced timeframe of 29 days with 64 matches to be played in
            eight venues across five cities. The Qatar national football
            team appeared at the event automatically at their first World
            Cup alongside 31 teams who were determined by qualification rounds.
            Qatar lost all three group matches, making them the first host to lose
            their opening game, the earliest a host was eliminated,and are the second
            host (after South Africa in 2010) not to progress past the first stage.</p>
